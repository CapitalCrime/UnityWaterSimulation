# UnityWaterSimulation

Simulation done for my computer animation class. It is an euler based simulation using a grid system. All calculations affect the simulation correctly except for the pressure calculation, which is why the particles can infinitely pile together in a single cell. The script for the simulation can be found on the main camera, where you can tweak all the parameters of the simulation.
